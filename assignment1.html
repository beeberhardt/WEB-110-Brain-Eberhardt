  <p>I want to discuss the IP Address and the location it gives using location databases. I have heard of an IP Address
    and was always curious if it was possible to get the exact location portrayed on television. I learned that IP
    Address is a Georeference referring to Geolocation that gives a possible physical location using a computer database
    and is available for purchase or free online. With the help of Geolocation, law enforcement can find scammers that
    are taking advantage of people and businesses. It also can change the content of the website based on user
    locations. I have learned If the IP Address is linked to the wrong location, not in the geographic area, and missing
    addresses from the database results of location will vary. I have learned why my virus protection warns me about my
    IP Address might be exposed.</p>

  <p>I would like to try and discuss tracing internet traffic. I have never heard of this before, and it looks like
    something out of Mr Robot. I learned that traceroute is built into most operating systems and could determine why a
    website is not loading correctly. The traceroute program can show the path that a website uses through the routers
    and locate the problem by troubleshooting network outages or packet loss. I searched en.wikiversity.org on
    traceroute-online.com and it is interesting to see the Host Name, ISP, Netblock, Country, Loss, and Response. Once I
    have a better understanding or have an expert watch me, I would like to try this when I have a website that doesn’t
    load correctly.</p>

  <p>I would like to discuss managing folders and files. I have been known to be disorganized when it comes to folder
    and file management. Especially working from Windows to Mac. This activity reminded me to keep the folder and file
    name simple. I will remember to double-check where I’m saving the folders and files. I understand the importance of
    great folder management. I need to make sure that documents, pictures, and videos are in the designated folder. I
    have also been reminded to make sure the autosave option is active. This feature has saved me several times when an
    unexpected outage happens. I can improve my skills as a Graphic Designer by understanding how folders and files work
    together.</p>
