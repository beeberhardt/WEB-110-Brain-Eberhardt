<h1 style="color: white;">Assignment 11</h1>
<p>I have only ever heard of and used Photoshop to edit photos. I enjoyed reading Picpzu&rsquo;s Photoshop guides. I never heard of GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP).&nbsp; I might consider trying Pixlr and see what its photo editing capabilities are.&nbsp; I also learned about Inkscape, and I like its Elements of Design overview.&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand the differences between raster and vector images because I have used them in several of my projects. I like to use Photoshop to edit my photos and Pixabay to look for vector images because they are royalty-free. I have never actually added a raster or vector image to a web page.&nbsp; I usually only use YouTube to watch how-to videos and have no interest in creating a profile to upload any videos. I will look into using other photo editing programs if I&rsquo;m having problems with my Adobe programs.</p>
