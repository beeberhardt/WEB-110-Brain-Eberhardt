  <p>I have only ever heard of and used Photoshop to edit photos. I enjoyed reading Picpzu&rsquo;s Photoshop guides. I
    never heard of GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP).&nbsp; I might consider trying Pixlr and see what its photo
    editing capabilities are.&nbsp; I also learned about Inkscape, and I like its Elements of Design
    overview.&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand the differences between raster and vector images because I have used them in
    several of my projects. I like to use Photoshop to edit my photos and Pixabay to look for vector images because they
    are royalty-free. I have never actually added a raster or vector image to a web page.&nbsp; I usually only use
    YouTube to watch how-to videos and have no interest in creating a profile to upload any videos. I will look into
    using other photo editing programs if I&rsquo;m having problems with my Adobe programs.</p>
