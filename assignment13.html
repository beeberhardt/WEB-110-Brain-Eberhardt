<canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="150" style="border:1px solid grey"></canvas>

const c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
const ctx = c.getContext("2d");

ctx.rect(20, 20, 150, 100);

  <p>I have heard of JavaScript but never knew what it contributes to website code.  I like the way tutorialspoint says “JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform”.  I also like the way the student presentation explains that HTML is the skeleton, CSS gives it looks, and JavaScript brings it to life.  I created a Codecademy to get a better understanding of Java.  I enjoyed learning how to create a canvas and look forward to trying different codes for different shapes. I liked adding the time and day. The w3schools is a great learning site for this assignment. I like that my shape and time and day are functional. .</p>
