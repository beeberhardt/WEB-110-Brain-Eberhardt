  <p>I have never heard of SQL. I learned it stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is what communicates with a database. I understand that a database is used to store information needed for SQL.  I enjoyed the Khan Academy videos. I learned about the applications of SQL and what it can do for a website. I enjoyed the sqlzoo site because they show the code and results. I liked going over the w3schools exercises. They ask you to write the answer to the statement and have the show answer available so I can complete the exercise. I feel that I have completed this assignment with the help of these videos.   . .</p>
