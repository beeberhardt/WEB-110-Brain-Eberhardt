  <p>I have never heard of Gantt. I like the way it helps with the process of organizing a project. It gives a great overview of tasks that need to be completed. I find the reminders and due dates helpful. The layout is very user-friendly and easy to use. I like the way it is capable of generating and editable in Excel.   I wish I had known about this process earlier it would have helped me stay more organized. I chose smartsheets.com to create my Gantt. The Gantt is very helpful in staying on track to complete a project and I will start using it for future projects.</p>
