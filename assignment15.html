  <p>It is nice to see what WAVE does to make sure a web page is accessible to people with disabilities. I found it interesting that they can check the contrast, features, and give you alerts. I was very happy that my web page passed. I have alerts only because those are assignments that need to be completed later. I like how the mdn web docs say, &ldquo;The key lesson here is to think beyond your own computer and how you use the web, and start learning about how others use it &mdash; you are not your users.&rdquo; I found the supercool list for writing good alt text very helpful. I will try to change my color scheme with Paletton when I feel more comfortable with my coding skills. I was very happy to learn about how W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) helps disabled people use the internet.</p>
