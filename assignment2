I want to discuss what I learned about web address URLs from the Web Brower activity. I learned that URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. I learned that the URL has identifiers. The HTTP:// is known as the scheme, followed by the domain name (Amazon.com), parameters randomly looking to us but important to the server and this shows up after searching, and finally the anchor that helps direct to the certain page. The www. is known as a sub-domain, the second level is the domain name, top leave is .com. I can be accurate when discussing the URL with someone who needs help understanding the breakdown.
	I want to discuss the different web browsers. I have never heard of Brave or Opera and I can’t afford to damage my computer by downloading a browser I’m unfamiliar with. I understand and feel comfortable using Chrome and maybe even Firefox.  Chrome has a lot of helpful programs such as Google Drive, Google Docs, and much more that I use to help me with school and personal needs.  I use Google Drive to automatically back up pictures and files. The one downside is that I managed to fill the space and I have to delete some pictures or files to make room.
	 I want to discuss the configure browser extensions and add-ons. Each browser has its way to customize or remove an extension. It is possible to and Grammarly as an extension. I use the free website version to check my grammar. I will be able to help my friends and family locate and delete any unwanted extensions with the help of this activity.
