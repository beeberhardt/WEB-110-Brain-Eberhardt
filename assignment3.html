<p>When it comes to searching on the World Wide Web (WWW) more efficiently. I learned that it is important to make sure keywords are used instead of a full question. Using keywords helps with a more accurate search. I found out about the advanced search and the fast facts that Google offers. I was informed it is also important to be alert when searching, just because it’s online doesn’t mean the information is accurate. I learned about snopes.com is known for verifying internet rumors. I learned the domains .gov, .edu and .org are more reliable than .com. I also learned the most common types of websites are commercial, organization, news sites, blogs, wiki, scholarly sites, databases, forums, question-and-answer, and (school) Harper’s Library website.  I was informed that Wiki is not the most reliable source and could not be used in a research paper because anyone can add information. That still makes sense to me, and I have avoided Wiki and blogs.   As a graphic design student, I have a fear of stealing images or plagiarizing paper. I make sure that I use royalty-free pictures from pixabay.com or unsplash.com for my images and use the Harper Library site for reliable research sites.</p> 

<p>When I think about search engines, I know Google or Yahoo.  I have not used Bing or Ask to search for information. There are several web search engines I have just learned that exist for different parts of the world. There is a Yandex search engine that reminds me of Ask and according to Google is Russian based, and Baidu is the Google of China. I have learned about a search engine named Dogpile and it doesn’t look like a real search engine but the name and its Go Fetch! as the search button is hilarious. I think that Google and Yahoo have the best interface. However, Google has the best usable results. The search engines Bing and Ask look identical. However, Bing has a better interface. The all-knowing Google has the highest search engine market share.  I will be able to search using Google much easier and obtain better results with the advanced search. I tried just using keywords and not typing a question and the difference I noticed is that the question typed out shows the people also ask for information.</p>

<p>I found the web.archive.org site to be very enlightening and informative. It is very user-friendly, and you can search the timeline for any website. I searched the history of Cartoonnetwork.com and Nick.com. I find it very interesting to see how much the sites have changed over the years. Nick.com has a record saved from 1996, and Cartoonnetwork.com from 1998. I will be using web.archive.gov to help see the history of a site I use for a reach paper to see how often it is changed. I learned that there is more than just MLA style when it comes to citing a reference and it looks to me, they all use the same information arranged differently. I will add the cite reference page to my favorites in case I need a different citation format besides MLA. Since this is a web class will we be using the Bib TeX cite format?</p>
