  <h1>Assignment 4</h1>
  <p>I have two main Emails Yahoo and two Gmail. I use my Yahoo for personal use and one Gmail is for Harper emails. The
    other Gmail I only created it as a backup for my phone, so I don’t lose my pictures or contacts. I have never heard
    of Thunderbird. I understand that it is a private email system also known as a user agent. These types of emails are
    often used by businesses that try and be more secure. I would download it to see what features it offers if I need
    an Email address. I learned the way a Private Email system travels before getting to a Web-based email. It starts
    from the user and goes through three different servers called message transfer agents (MTA) that use simple mail
    transfer protocol (SMTP) to communicate and goes through a whole different internet path to get to the web-based
    user. If the web-based user wanted to send an email back to the Private Email System, the whole process would be
    reversed.</p>

  <p>I was unaware of the term Email spoofing. The term reminds me of regular unwanted spam emails. I became aware of
    the term Phishing emails before this assignment thanks to a friend of mine that works in cybersecurity. I learned
    how to check where an email came from by checking the full header. I will use this feature to see how the email was
    sent by the sender. It was interesting to see the message heading results from an email that Dave sent out. Seeing
    the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all say pass along with it shows mail relay from blackbord.com is interesting.</p>

  <p>I have signed up for a few mailing lists and have realized that my personal email is too long. I understand that I
    could make a new one. However, it’s already tied to all my personal accounts, and I would have to change it on every
    account. I have signed up for Thorntons Gas. Petco, Red Box, and care2. I signed up for these mailing lists because
    they all offer coupons and rewards. Except care2 is a mailing list that sends out petitions to try and help get
    justice for an incident that has happened. With the help of email, people are able to be more efficient in everyday
    life and work.</p>
