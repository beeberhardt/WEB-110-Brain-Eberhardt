<p>I have no interest whatsoever when it comes to social media platforms. I will not be creating an account for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Tik Tok, Blog, hashtag, Twitter, or Tumblr. I truly dislike everything about social media platforms.  I thought they were going to be a fad and eventually go away for good. I was so wrong. I don’t trust any social media platforms. This was before the news of them all stealing personal information finally leaked out. However, people are still hooked and use them just because they want five minutes of fame or to make virtual friends. It is too easy to create an account for any social media that people make Catfish accounts.  Catfish is a term used for a fake account. I especially dislike influencers getting paid to do nothing. I do however like how YouTube is around to help figure out a problem. An example is when I forgot how to change the oil life on my vehicle and after searching, I was able to find a good step-by-step video on how to change it. I created a LinkedIn account. I created this account to get help from an artist for a research paper.  It was a surprise to me and my instructor that he replied. I also have a Pinterest account just to look for different pallet projects. I think Social media platforms were created with good intentions, but they bring out the bad, very ugly/nasty in some people because they are hiding behind a screen.</p>

<p>I think all the social media platforms follow the Honeycomb Social Media Functionality Model. They all show the presence, relationship, reputation, groups, conversations, sharing, and identity of the user. That’s why I dislike social media. Everybody is going to know more than they should even if your account is set to privet.  I understand that social media platforms occasionally help people.  It still doesn't seem right to hear on the news “Thanks to Facebook.”  What I truly don’t understand is that nowadays if an unfortunate situation is happening that people pull out their phones to start recording for their social media page instead of trying to help or call for help. I will never understand the real reason behind social media.</p>

<p>I understand that WhatsApp is created by Facebook. However, I’m going to try it out because it looks to be very user-friendly, and it doesn’t charge for international messages or calls. It is also nice that it does not need Wi-Fi.  I like the way you can see when the message was sent with a checkmark and viewed with a double-blue checkmark in the corner. You are also able to customize the chat box and background, and status, and create groups.  I like how when I send a video it is not distorted.  I don’t understand why but Android phones don’t send or receive videos clearly in regular text messages but I’m still not going to change to Apple.  Google Hangouts is just as good as WhatsApp except they charge for international calls and messages. I have used Skype and it’s not very reliable. The call would always drop or not connect at all.  I’m grateful to have learned about WhatsApp and hope I don’t regret it because it’s owned by Facebook.</p>
