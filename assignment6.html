<p>These career planning activities should be available for students starting high school.  I have always had the concept of art and graphic design.  I thought it would be impossible to become an actual artist, so I decided to try graphic design because where there is advertising there is usually a graphic designer behind it.  I enjoyed assessing myself and the career planning worksheet. I would like to work with people who have similar values as I do when designing, one of my values is to meet the client's vision.  This was a hard value to get through because it's tough for me to take criticism.  However, with the help of my friends, family, and teachers remind me just make the changes and work with them to see their vision. I understand that I still do great work and just need to accept that people will ask for changes.  I enjoy starting from a sketch and bringing it to life if an Adobe program. The sketch that made me realize that I enjoy graphic design was my character R.Z.M (Robot Zombie Monkey).  My personality can be both introverted and extroverted.  I start nervous and then when I get comfortable, I become engaged. I like to work in a fast-paced environment, so I’m never just bored. I can work in a low-key environment if it’s with other people.  I have the skills just not enough real experience. I have my associate degree and I’m hoping this certificate will look good on my resume.  I’m still looking forward to becoming an entry-level graphic designer.</p>

<p>I have used resume templates and every time I get assistants with my resume, they advise me to not use a template and just type it in Word.  I had what I thought was a clean and simple template and the advisor for the internship program at Harper suggested not to use it because it was not professional looking.   I understand the importance of a resume and unfortunately, my resume has few experiences as a real graphic designer.  I have registered for the internship program at Harper because it’s exactly the experience I would need to get paid training and experience in the field.  I wish that when I was in high school this course was around because I would be in a better situation and understand the job market.</p>

<p>I have some understanding of LinkedIn. LinkedIn is often considered a social media platform focused on professional networking. While it allows you to connect with friends, join groups, and post various information, upon exploring LinkedIn, I have noticed its similarity to Facebook. There is even a LinkedIn instant messaging. I created a LinkedIn account intending to find a graphic design position, and it has helped me connect with an artist who assisted me with my research paper. As I continue to learn more about LinkedIn, I plan to use it for job searching and connecting with my fellow students. However, I intend to have professional content if I do decide to post anything. </p>
