  <h1>Assignment 7</h1>
  <p>I have heard of OSI but now I know it stands for Open System Interface. I have never heard of the International
    Organization of Standardization (ISO) or TCP/IP. I learned about the seven layers of the OSI model and their
    responsibilities. There is the application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical
    meaning router. The physical layer oversees the activation, voltage, and data rates. The data link layer helps with
    error control. The network layer helps with determining the way the data should be taken. The transport layer helps
    the network layer’s process better by shrinking the data. The session layer identifies the user and controls logging
    on/off. The presentation layer makes sure the information is in the correct form for the receiving system. The
    application layer performs the login and password check feature. I learned that TCP/IP stands for Transmission
    Control Protocol and Internet Protocol which is the model for the Internet. I learned that the TCP/IP model has four
    layers and protocols. There’s application/transport (same as OSI), internet, and host-to-network that is the
    physical and data link combined. The internet layer permits packets but might be rearranged when received. The
    host-to-network layer makes the user connect to the network so IP packets can be sent over. I learned the different
    internet protocols (TCP) Transmission Control Protocol, (IP) internet protocol, (UDP) user datagram protocol, (FTP)
    file transfer protocol, (TFTP) trivial file transfer protocol, telnet, (HTTP) hypertext transfer protocol, and HTTP
    response. I understand what an IP address is. I had no idea that URL meant uniform resource locator. I learned the
    two URL forms absolute and relative. I will be saving the domain name chart. It is going to be very helpful.</p>

  <p>I will be saving this Wi-Fi connection troubleshooting and changing TCP/IP. I occasionally help my grandfather with
    most computer problems. I will be more prepared to help check his internet signal and connection. I will try to
    enable DHCP or change his TCP/IP setting. I wish I knew this the last time I had a very hard time fixing his
    connection. I was on the phone with customer support for hours and it eventually got fixed.</p>

  <p>I learned about the run command window and the command prompt. It is very interesting to see all this computer
    language and be able to understand a good amount of it. I use a hotspot to connect to the internet and it shows all
    the information. It is fun to type different commands in the run and command window. I have always seen my friend’s
    work screen look like the Matrix because she is in cyber security. Now I can say “So what are you typing in the
    command window?”.</p>
