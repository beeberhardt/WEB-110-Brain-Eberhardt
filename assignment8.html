	The internet is a very dangerous place and thanks to understanding the basic dos and don’ts I feel that I generally feel okay while using the internet.  I learned that to have a safe password I shouldn’t use the same password for everything should be six characters long with numbers, special characters, and a mix of lower/capital letters, and I didn’t know you should avoid using dictionary words.  I have used the password generator. However, they are too random and unless I write them down, I don’t remember it. Most people are aware of the joke of not having a password as your password.  I have a system for creating my passwords.   I always look for the security symbol when searching online. It gives me a little piece of mind for security.  I learned the importance of keeping the browser up to date. I’m learning more about phishing and malware, and it is very disturbing what hackers can do. My cyber security friend has informed me if I don’t recognize the email don’t even open it just click spam.   I just learned about and activated the ask before displaying the external images option. I will be setting that up for family members.  I wish everyone was aware of the Google transparency report. It’s easy to use and a great way to avoid a hazardous site. I just started PayPal to shop online, and it seems safe. I learned more about cookies and how they store specific information creating those annoying ads of recent interests. My antivirus protection has saved me a few times when I was looking for a free website for pictures to use for projects. I just started accepting phone notifications and you must pay attention because it can unfortunately be a scam called Smishing. This lesson has informed me of ways I can help myself and my family stay a little safer online.

	I like how the comparison of the antivirus software list shows everything from price, first release, and country of origin. I have downloaded Avast free version.  It looks like it has what I need to avoid having a problem. I have just run the smart scan and it found no browser threats, viruses & malware, and has found three advanced issues that I have to pay for a subscription to fix. I was looking forward to testing my anti-malware until I read this IMPORTANT NOTE EICAR cannot be held responsible when these files or your AV scanner in combination with these files cause any damage to your computer. YOU DOWNLOAD THESE FILES AT YOUR OWN RISK. I can’t afford to have my computer defective. Once I find a better free virus protection, I might try it.
