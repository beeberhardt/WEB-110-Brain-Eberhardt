Summary paragraph goes here ...I have always heard of HTML. I understand that it’s code to build a website. I learned that it stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. I have also learned if you type one letter or symbol out of place the code will simply not work correctly. I discovered some free HTML code editors that show you the code and what you would see on the site.  That really helps me because I’m a visual learner. When I type a code for, and image and the image doesn’t show up then I know the code is mistyped. I really enjoy the way w3schoold.com shows their information on coding, it will help me out a lot in the long run. I’m looking forward to not disliking coding.
